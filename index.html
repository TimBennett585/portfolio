        <h2>About Tim</h2>
        <p>After finishing my degree in Music Business from SUNY Fredonia, I worked with several smaller touring bands from NY and even into Nebraska.
            I served as their Tour Manager, keeping track of the financials, contacts, lodging, routing, well basically everything that kept the tour moving productively and on time!!</p>

            <p>Having done that for several years, it was increasinglt obvious that to make that a larger career, I would need to invest all of my time for years on making that dream happen, 
            and there would still be no guarantees. I then shifted focus into my part-time retail job with the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company and worked my way up to being a Training Store Manager,
            where I celebrated more than a decade with the company.</p>
            <p>But, like many, after COVID hit, I re-evaluated my priorities and I knew that a change needed to be made. After soul-searching and 
            discussing with friends and loved ones, I decided in 2023 to make the leap into learning programming and development and enrolled with Thinkful. I recently completed the program and wrapped up several projects, and have
            embraced the challenge of learning so many new things. I am truly excited to see what the future holds and am fully committed to the grind!!</p>
